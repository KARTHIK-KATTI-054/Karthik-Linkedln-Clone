# Karthik-Linkedln-Clone
This project is a LinkedIn-inspired social networking platform that allows users to create profiles, connect with others, and share posts. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it replicates core LinkedIn functionalities like authentication, posting updates, likes, and comments. The UI is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

Features to Build: 
1. User Login & Signup 
• Users should be able to register with email and password. 
• After registration, they should log in to use the website. 
• Once logged in, show the user’s name or profile on the top bar. 
2. Create Post 
• After login, the user can write a post (text content, like “Hello world!”). 
• Each post should have: 
o User’s name 
o Post text 
o Time when it was created 
3. View All Posts 
• All users can see posts made by every registered user (like a public feed). 
• Show the latest posts first.
